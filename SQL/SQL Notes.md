It’s the top-level container where all databases live.
# Databases
A collection of schemas and tables that store related data.
We write queries to interact with data inside a database.
#  Schemas
A logical structure inside a database that organizes tables, views, and other database objects.
Schemas help manage and group related objects.
#  Tables
A collection of rows and columns that hold actual data.
Just like a sheet in Excel, it's where we store and query real information.

A field is a column in a table.
It stores a specific type of data for each record (row).

A record is a row in a table — also called an entry.
It contains all the field values for one item/person.
