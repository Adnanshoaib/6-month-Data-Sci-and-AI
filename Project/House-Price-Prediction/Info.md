# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts house prices using multiple regression algorithms and compares their performance. It also includes saving models as .pkl files for deployment with Streamlit/Flask.

# 🔑 Key Features

✅ Multiple regression algorithms implemented & compared
✅ Model evaluation with MAE, MSE, R²
✅ Trained models saved using Pickle
✅ Results stored in model_evaluation_results.csv
✅ Deployable in a web app for real-time predictions
