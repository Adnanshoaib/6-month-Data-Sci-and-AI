# Machine Learning :- 
Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
It’s like giving examples (data) to a computer, and it learns patterns from them to solve future problems.
  - Example:
       If you give a machine 1000 photos of cats and dogs (with labels), it learns the difference, and then can predict whether a new photo is a cat or a dog.
# Types of Data :- 
  - Structured Data :-
      - Organized in rows and columns (like Excel, CSV).
      - ML mostly works with structured data.
  - Unstructured Data :-
      - Not organized in table format (like images, audio, text).
      - Mostly used in AI applications.
# How Machine Learns the Data :-
  - Training Phase – Model learns from historical data
  - Testing Phase – Model is tested on unseen data
  - Validation Phase – Optional step to tune the model using a small portion of future-like data (validation data)
# Real life machine learning applications :-
  - YouTube Recommendations – Learn from your watch history.
  - Spam Detection in Gmail – Learn patterns in spam emails.
  - Voice Assistants( Siri,Alexa ) – Learn how you speak.
  - Face Unlock on Phones – Learn to recognize your face.
# Difference btw Traditional Programming & Machine Learning :-
  - Traditional Programming :-
      - In traditional programming, a programmer writes rules (logic) and inputs data to get the output.
      - Flow :-
          - Rules (Logic) + Data ⇒ Output
      - Who writes rules? Human (programmer)
  -  Machine Learning :-
      - In ML, we provide the machine with data and the correct output (labels), and it learns the rules by itself.
      - Flow :-
          - Data + Output (Labels) ⇒ Model (Learns Rules)
      - Who learns rules? Machine (algorithm)
