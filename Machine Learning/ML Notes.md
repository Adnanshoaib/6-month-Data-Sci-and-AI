# Machine Learning :- 
Machine Learning (ML) is a way to teach computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.
Itâ€™s like giving examples (data) to a computer, and it learns patterns from them to solve future problems.
Example:
If you give a machine 1000 photos of cats and dogs (with labels), it learns the difference, and then can predict whether a new photo is a cat or a dog.
