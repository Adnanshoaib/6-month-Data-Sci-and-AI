# Introduction of Python:-
         - python is a high level , easy to learn programming language that is widely used in Data science .
         - Python have easy to Write & Read Syntax.Python have large no.of labraries.
         - Strong communication Supports.

# Why Python For Data Sci:-
         -In Data Science Python is Used to collect,clean,analyze,visualize and help to predict data.
         -It's used Labraries like 
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Matplotib
  - Scikit-learn

# Variaables and DataTypes :-
            - Variables are containers for storing data values.
            - You don’t need to declare the type; Python automatically understands it.
            - python variables are case sensitive.
            - pyhton allow assinging values to multiple variables in a single line.

# EX :-
     a = 10 
           a is name of the variable and 10 is value store in x variable.

# Datatype :-

  a =  10  ---> int
  b = 23.4 ---> float
  c = "nit" ---> str
  d = True ---> boolean
  e = 1+2j ---> complex

# Pyhton-TypeCasting:-
             -Type Casting in Python refers to the process of converting the data type of a variable from one type to another,
such as from a string to an integer, a float to an integer, etc.

# Data Structure in pyhton :-

       # Data Type :-
                -User or Developer define only one value.
       # Data Structure :-
                 -User or Developer can define more than one values.
       # Matrix :-
              -Tables(rows and columns )

   matrix = collection of data structures .
   data structure = collection of data types.

#python Data Structure are devided into 2 types :-

                      1) Inbuild DS :- List , Tuples , Set , Dict .
                      2) User def DS :- Stack, Linkedlist , Heap , Tree , ( normally used by some labraries ).

# Inbuild Data Structure
1) List :-
         - List is Growable.
         - List define with []
         - Duplicates are allowed.
         - Multiple datatypes can declare.
         - List is Mutable (you can change values).

# Methods of List :-

1) append() :-
      - It's a build in method in pyhton used to add an item to the end of a list.
2) copy() :-
    - copy() is a built-in method used to create a shallow copy of a list.
3) Count() :-
    - count() returns the number of times a specific value appears in a list.
4) pop() :-
    - pop() removes and returns an element from a list by index; if no index is given, it removes the last item.

5) remove() :-
    - remove() deletes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list (does not return it).
6) Difference Between pop() and remove():-
    - pop(index) removes and returns an item by index.
    - remove(value) deletes the first matching value (does not return it).
7) insert():-
    - insert(index, value) adds a value at the specified index in the list without replacing existing elements.
8) extned():-
    -extend() adds each element from another list to the end of the current list.
9) reverse() :-
    - reverse() reverses the elements of the list in place (modifies the original list).

10) sort() :-
     - sort() arranges the elements of a list in ascending (default) or descending order.
11) clear() :-
     - clear() removes all elements from the list, making it an empty list.
12) del listname :-
     - del deletes the entire list from memory (not just its contents).
13) len() :-
     - len() returns the total number of items in a list.

2) Tuple :-
        -Tuple is an ordered collection of elements.
        -Tuple are immutable.
        -Once created, you cannot change its values.

            ex----> tup1 = (1,2,3,4,"rehan") # tuple

 # Methods of Tuple :-

      1) count(x)	:-
            -Counts how many times x appears..
      2)index(x) :-
            -Returns the first index where x is located	.

3) Dictionary :-
        - Dictionary is an unordered collection of key values pairs enclosed with {}.
        - Dict is Mutable.

  # Methods of Dict :-

       1) keys() :-
             -Returns a view of all the keys.
       2) values() :-
            - Returns a view of all the values.
       3) update() :-
            - Updates dictionary with another dictionary or key-value pair.
       4) pop():-
           - Removes a key and returns its value.
       5) clear() :-
           - clear all dict elements.


4) Set :-
      - set is an unorderd collection of elemnts enclosed in {}.
      - Duplicates are not allowed in set.
      - Automatically removes repeated items.

  # Methods of LisSrt :-

    1) add() :- 
            - add new element.
    2) remove() :-
            - remove if found , Error if not found.
    3) discard() :-
            - No error if not found.
    4) union() :-
            - Combines sets (all unique elements).
    5) intersection() :-
            - print Common elements from two sets

   # Superset , Subset , Disjoint :-

    1) issuperset() :-
            -Checks if a set contains all elements of another set.
    2) issubset():-
            - Checks if all elements of one set are present in another.
    3) isdisjoint() :-
            - Checks if two sets have no elements in common.

# range() :-
     - range() is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

- EX ---> list(range(0,10)) 
- O/P :- [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

- start → (Optional) Starting number (default is 0)
- stop → (Required) The number at which the range stops (not included)
- step → (Optional) The increment (default is 1)

* Common Use Cases:-
- For loops
- Generating sequences
- Iterating indexes in lists
