# What is Deep Learning :-
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns from data.

- Inspired by the human brainâ€™s neurons and synapses.
- Works best with large datasets and high computational power.
- Core idea: Forward Propagation (make predictions) + Backward Propagation (learn from errors).

# ðŸ”¹ Difference Between AI, ML, and DL :-

- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Broad field of creating intelligent machines.
- Machine Learning (ML): AI subset that learns from data.
- Deep Learning (DL): ML subset using multi-layered neural networks.
