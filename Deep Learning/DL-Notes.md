# What is Deep Learning :-
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns from data.

- Inspired by the human brain’s neurons and synapses.
- Works best with large datasets and high computational power.
- Core idea: Forward Propagation (make predictions) + Backward Propagation (learn from errors).

# Difference Between AI, ML, and DL :-

- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Broad field of creating intelligent machines.
- Machine Learning (ML): AI subset that learns from data.
- Deep Learning (DL): ML subset using multi-layered neural networks.

# Basic Workflow of Deep Learning

Input Data → Images, Text, Audio, or Numerical data.
Forward Propagation → Data flows through layers, prediction is made.
Loss Calculation → Compare prediction with actual value.
Backward Propagation (Backprop) → Error sent backwards to update weights.
Optimization → Use algorithms like Gradient Descent & Adam Optimizer.
Repeat (Epochs) until the model converges.
