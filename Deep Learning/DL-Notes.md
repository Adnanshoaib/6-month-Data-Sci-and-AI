# What is Deep Learning :-
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns from data.

- Inspired by the human brainâ€™s neurons and synapses.
- Works best with large datasets and high computational power.
- Core idea: Forward Propagation (make predictions) + Backward Propagation (learn from errors).
